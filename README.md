# CS 498RK Sp19 Team "live like a dream"

According to Wikipedia, “eye tracking is the process of measuring either the point of gaze (where one is looking) or the motion of an eye relative to the head.” We are interested in the former part of the definition. By using some JS libraries, for example, WebGazer.js, we can easily get the point of gaze. Then we can map it to the screen (see screenshot below for example). Eye tracking technology can be useful in various applications, including recommendation systems for users’ interests and advertisement designs. In this project, we plan to build a simple application to browse the web pages.
